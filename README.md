## Technologies Used

 * Reason React
 * React Native
 * hew/styled-functors
 * (bs-)react-navigation

## Quick Facts

 * 100% Written in reasonml
 * 100% React Native (Web)
 * 100% a blast to build

## Motivations

I wanted to demonstrate how to write type-safe, x-platform UI code using Reasonml.

## Project Structure 

* `src/shared` - components & logic that are shared across the different platforms.
* `src/[web/mobile]` - platform-specific code.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), which gives you the following scripts:

* `npm start` Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
* `npm run watch` - Compiles Reason code (needed to run `npm start`)
* `npm test` Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
* `npm run build` Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
* `npm run eject` **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back! So don't ever use this and then commit the changes to master.**
